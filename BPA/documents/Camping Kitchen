Camping Kitchen

	Materials:

	- 48" X 96" sheet of 1/2inch plywood
	- 4 sets of hinges
	- 2 latches
	- 2 Magnets closures
	- Wood Glue
	- Wood Screws

	Tools Needed:

	- Screwdriver
	- Tape Measure
	- Drill with drill bits
	- Pencils
	- Square
	- Skill Saw (for cutting wood to size, if not available most big hardware stores offer cuts for minimal cost)
	- Small Handsaw
	- Safety glasses

	What you'll do:

	Step 1:

	Measure your equipment. The dimenstions if your box may vary depending on what you indend to carry. For this example we are making a box that measures 28" long, 16.5" wide, and 21" tall. Using the single sheet of plywood you should be able to get the following cuts:

		A: 15.5" X 20" for the sides QTY 2
		B: 20" X 28" for the front and back QTY 2
		C: 16" X 28" for the top and bottom QTY 2
		D: 15" X 27" for the shelves QTY 2
		E: 27" X 5" for the shelf face boards QTY 2
		F: 3.5" X 15" for the shelf dividers QTY 2
	 Note: You will have some scrap wood left over


	Step 2:

	Line up your back and side pieces and mark out where your shelving will be. Your shelf height could vary depending on what you plan on storing in your box. Marking the shelving placement now will make it easier to screw in your shelves once the frame of the box has been built.

	Step 3:

	Assemble the back and sides of the box. If you are not able to use self-drilling screws, you should drill guide holes where you plan on placing them. Use wood glue to fill in any seams. After glue has had a chance to dry, attach the bottom of the box using the same steps.

	Step 4:

	If necessary, assemble any shelving outside of the box. If you have multiple shelves, or they are connected, make sure the top and bottom are square. This will make installation much easier.

	Step 5:

	Insert the shelving, aligning with the previously maked lines. After using the screws to secure the shelving in to place, make sure to use the wood glue and glue any seams.

	Step 6:

	Align and install latches to the top and opening side compartment. 

	Step 7: 

	Align and install hinges for top and side panel.

	Step 8:

	Find a friend to brag to and then high five! You're done!
