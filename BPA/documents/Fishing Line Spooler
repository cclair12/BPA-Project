	Materials:
	- 3/8 by 6inch bolt and suitable hex-nut
	- 3/8 washers
	- 3/8 inch wingnut
	- Compression spring to fit over bolt
	- 10inch by 6inch piece of wood, at least one inch thick
	- 16inch by 6inch piece of wood, at least one inch thick
	- Wood Screws
	- Wood Adhesive
	- Drill with drill bits
	- Saw, if your wood will need to be trimmed to size. 

	What you'll do:

	Step 1:

	If they are not already, cut your wood pieces to size. You will need two pieces, one 16 inches long and one 10 inches long. The longer piece will form your base, the shorter be the standing piece.

	Step 2:

	Drill a hole about 2/3 of the way up on the standing piece, ensuring that the hole is centered. On the larger base piece, pre-drill screw holes on one side so you may secure the two pieces of wood together.

	Step 3:

	Construct the frame using the wood screws and the pre-drilled holes on the base. It should form an "L" shape once completed.

	Step 4:

	With the frame constructed, push the bolt through the hole on the upright board and secure. If it its a double threaded bolt, use a hex-nut and washer to hold it in place. If the bolt has a head on it, push the bolt in as far as you can, and secure with wood ahesive. Wait for adhesive to dry before moving on to the next step.

	Step 5:

	Place a washer on to the bolt, followed by the compression spring, followed by another washer. The spring keeps the pressure consistant, helping to keep tention on the spool of line against it. Use another washer, followed by a wing nut to increase or descrease the tention against the spool. Your device is now ready to use.
