Homemade Cover Scent

	Materials:

	- Large pot
	- Empty spray bottle
	- Cheesecloth, or some other means to remove particles from the water (an old shirt works well in a pinch)
	- Vegetation from your desired hunting region. The more aromatic the vegetation, the better your end result will be. Evergreen materials tend to work the best, but deciduous leaves, nuts and fruit from the area, even loose soil are good choices.

	What you'll do:

	Step 1:

	Place vegetation in to pot and cover with water. It's best to use as little water as possible, this helps with the concentration of your final product.

	Step 2:

	Bring the water to a boil, and let simmer for 20-30 minutes. The longer the better, but do not go too long or you will start to lose some of the aroma you're trying to capture.

	Step 3:

	Strain your cover scent through your cheesecloth to remove all of the solids from your product that may clog your spray bottle. Note: To do this thouroughly, you may need to filter more than once. Once filtered, allow to cool.

	Step 4:

	Once cool, transfer scent to spray bottle. Label if necessary, then you're ready for the field!
