Firewood Sling

	Materials:

	- One large tote bag, cavass is a good choice for its strength. Make sure there is not a seam along the bottom (It would not be able to handle the strain very long if there is one)
	- Thread
	- Fabric Sheers, or heavy duty scissors
	- Sewing Machine w/heavy duty needle
	- Pins (Binder clips work well if you don't have many sewing materials laying around)
	- Pencil
	- Ruler

	What you'll do:

	Step 1:

	Turn the tote bag inside out. Using the fabric sheers, cut along the seams. Make sure to trim off any seam allowances.

	Step 2: 

	Pick a corner. Measuring from the top, measure in 4 inches towards the handle, and then 7 inches down. Draw a diagonal line between the two points, then cut off the triangle. Repeat with remaining corners.

	Step 3:

	Using your sewing machine, finish the raw edges of the cuts you made. A zigzag stitch works well.

	Step 4: 

	Fold in the sides of the tote as well as the finished corners a 1/4 inch. Finish with a topstich using your sewing machine.

	Step 5 (optional):

	Fold each of the handles back on itself, and use the pins to hold it in place. Sew across the layerd handle and over the overlapped area. Your end result will be a shorter, stronger handle for your sling.

	Step 6:

	Hit the campsite and start gathering, you're done!
