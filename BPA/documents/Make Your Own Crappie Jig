Make Your Own Crappie Jig

	Materials:
	- Fly tying vice
	- Fly tying bobbin
	- Scissors
	- Lead jig head hooks
	- Fly head cement
	- Lacquer paints
	- Chenille
	- Marabou feathers
	- Waxed Monocord thread

	What you'll do:

	Step 1:

	Gather your materials. You'll want everything to be easily accessed while you use the tying vice. You can pick any combination of colors you desire, it's recommeneded that your monohord matches the chenille and marabou you plan on using. It's also advised you use lacquer when painting jig heads, it will have a smoother final product and is more abbrasion resistant. 

	Step 2:

	To paint your jig head, hold the hook between two fingers and dip the head in to the bottle of lacquer paint. Once coated, remove from the bottle and allow the excess paint to drip. This will allow for a smoother finish over brushing the paint on. Place the jig head in the tying vice to complete drying. 

	Step 3:

	Once the paint has dried completely, remove the dried paint around the hook eye using a pin. Then, place the hook in to the vice right where the hook begins to bend. Beginning right behind the head, use the monochord to wrap the hook shank until you reach the hook barb. Allow the thread and bobbin to hang in that position until they next step.

	Step 4:

	Using the feather you have chosen, remove feather strands with your fingers. Place the feather ends against the head, making sure they extend to the desired amount past the hook bend. Once the desired length is achieved, wrap the thread around the feather, attaching to the hook shank.

	Step 5:

	Take the chenille and place on top of the wrapped marabou feather. Using the thread, wrap the chenille around the shank of the hook two to three times, making sure to end the wrap towards the jig head. Leave the thread and bobbin hanging until the next step. Once wrapped in thread, in wrap the chenille around the shank of the hook in a forawrd direction, stopping behind the jig head. 

	Step 6:

	Using about 5 turns, wrap the monochord over the chenille and then trim the access. Make sure the thread is wrapped evenly, with a roughly 1/6th collar against the jig head. To finish, make 3 half hitches in to the collar. Use the fly head cement to coat the collar. Once the cement is dry, cut the thread. Your jig is now ready to catch fish!
