      <h2>Casey Clair</h2>
      <p>Casey graduated in 2015 from Oklahoma State University, where his beard thrived. He worked full time for about a year, where his beard became unhappy. After discovering a passion for web development, Casey enrolled at Francis Tuttle Technology Center. He continues to persue his thirst for knowledge, well on his way to his career of choice. When not busy with school or work, Casey enjoys keeping up with the OKC Thunder, making sure his beard is trimmed and square, and generally accepting rugged manliness.</p>

      <h2>Jared Pisano</h2>
      <p>Jared spent the majority of his adult life so far working in Customer Service, always in either a retail or IT setting. Once he discovered a deep interest in Web Development, he began persuing classes at Francis Tuttle and persuing a career that he would be happy doing. When he's not busy, you'll probably find him spending time with his girlfriend, fishing a local dock, playing games with his friends, or making obsure movie references.</p>
