      <h2>Casey Clair</h2>
      <p>Casey graduated in 2015 from Oklahoma State University, where his beard thrived. He worked full time for about a year, where his beard became unhappy. After discovering a passion for web development, Casey enrolled at Francis Tuttle Technology Center. He continues to persue his thirst for knowledge, well on his way to his career of choice. When not busy with school or work, Casey enjoys keeping up with the OKC Thunder, making sure his beard is trimmed and square, and generally accepting rugged manliness.</p>

      <h2>Jared Pisano</h2>
      <p>Jared spent the majority of his adult life so far working in Customer Service, always in either a retail or IT setting. Once he discovered a deep interest in Web Development, he began classes at Francis Tuttle and persuing a career that he would be happy doing. When he's not busy, you'll probably find him spending time with his girlfriend, fishing a local dock, playing games with his friends, or obsessing over Star Wars.</p>

      <p>Prior to enrolling in the Web Design and Development class at Francis Tuttle, Josh completed the carpentry courses that are also offered on campus. He enjoys working with his hands, though he's not quite sure what to do with them during interviews. A self proclaimed "food connoisseur", Josh also enjoys video games, being French, and reaching things off the top shelf for people who are shorter than he is.</p>

      <p>That's Quinn to his friends. Quinn has had an interest in computers, especially code, for many years now.

If he's not working, you'll usually find him playing games or spending time with his friends and family, sleeping, or creating memes.</p>
